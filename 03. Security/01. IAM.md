Identities
The core feature of IAM is identities, a type of AWS resource. AWS services always expose APIs you can call using some identity; this tells AWS who you are (authentication) and whether you’re allowed to do what you’re doing (authorization).

There are two major forms of identities in IAM: users, and roles.
