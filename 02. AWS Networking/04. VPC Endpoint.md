Interface endpoint is an elastic network interface (ENI) with a private IP address from the IP address range of userâ€™s subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. It enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses.

Gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. Currently supports S3 and DynamoDB services.
