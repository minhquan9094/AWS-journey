- VPC endpoint enables creation of a private connection between VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink using its private IP address. Traffic between VPC and AWS service does not leave the Amazon network.






When? 

- When internal resource need connect to AWS services: SFTP, S3, DynamoDB, RabbitMQ,... without internet access/ public accessible


How? 


- Interface endpoint is an elastic network interface (ENI) with a private IP address from the IP address range of userâ€™s subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. It enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses.

- Gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. Currently supports S3 and DynamoDB services.
