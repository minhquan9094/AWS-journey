### WHEN ?

Direct Connect: Organizations that host resources in a data center can use AWS Direct Connect can setup a private connection to AWS. A direct connect will not traverse the Internet like a VPN which generally reduces latency and improves performance and security. The organization will need to implement encryption as this is simply a connection, not a VPN or encrypted tunnel.

Transit VPC: Often organizations are connecting many VPCs, not just one. A transit VPC can simplify a network design by connecting a location to a single VPC and from there, that VPC manages all the connections to the other VPCs.

Transit Gateway: A Transit Gateway also simplifies hybrid network architectures by connecting on-premises networks to AWS using a single Transit Gateway that acts as a hub instead of managing a number of complex peering relationships.

Private Link: AWS Private Link allows a vendor to set up a service for private access within the AWS network. You can also access AWS services that are available via Private Link.

VPC Endpoint: You set up a VPC endpoint in your VPC to connect to a service available via Private Link. There are different types of VPC endpoints covered in an upcoming post. Many AWS services require your applications and resources to make a request destined for the Internet to connect to them. You can create a VPC Endpoint to connect to those services via Private Link if you donâ€™t want to set up a NAT to allow those resources to get to the Internet and additionally keep the traffic on the AWS network instead.
